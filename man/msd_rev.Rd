\title{Reverse Mean Signed Deviation}
\usage{
msd_rev(data, ...)

\method{msd_rev}{data.frame}(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, case_weights = NULL, ...)

msd_rev_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, case_weights = NULL, ...)
}
\description{
This metric computes the mean signed deviation as `estimate - truth`. It is a
thin wrapper around `yardstick::msd()`, returning the negative of `msd()`'s output, so that
the positive value indicate that `estimate` are overestimated.
}
\details{
By default, `yardstick::msd()` calculates `truth - estimate`. This "reverse" version
flips that sign, effectively computing `estimate - truth`.
