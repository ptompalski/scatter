\title{Relative Mean Difference (RMD)}
\usage{
rmd(data, ...)

\method{rmd}{data.frame}(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, case_weights = NULL, ...)

rmd_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, case_weights = NULL, ...)
}
\description{
Computes the relative mean signed deviation between `estimate` and `truth`,
calculated as the mean of (`estimate - truth`) divided by the mean of `truth`,
expressed as a percentage. Positive values indicate overestimation.

This is a thin wrapper around `yardstick::msd()`, with reversed sign and
scaled by the mean of the true values. The default `yardstick::msd()` computes
`truth - estimate`, while this function computes `estimate - truth`.
}
\details{
The relative mean difference is useful when comparing average deviations
across models or datasets, as it expresses the difference relative to the
size of the true value. It supports optional case weights and handles missing
values similarly to other `yardstick` metrics.
